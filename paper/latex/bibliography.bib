However, it is important to also understand the structural characteristics of current online sports betting products, and how these products may continue to evolve via a forward-looking analysis of utility patents, given the increasing international popularity of this gambling mode. A scoping review of the emergent structural characteristics associated with online sports betting was conducted upon the literature (2015–2022), and of sports betting utility patents. A total of 26 literature records and 8 utility patents were included. Results indicated that online sports betting is instantly accessible, provides rapid and continuous betting opportunities, and offers user-interactivity via features such as ‘cash-out’ and the ability to instantly deposit funds. Additionally, the online sports betting market has expanded into adjacent industries such as esports. The included utility patents suggest that online sports betting may evolve by incorporating peer-to-peer competitive elements, augmented reality, and highly specific statistics/notifications. Overall, the online environment has transformed sports betting into a faster and more harmful gambling mode that provides a diverse range of features and betting opportunities. It is important that this area of research develops in order to encourage appropriate policy and the more ethical redesign of online sports betting products. }

By examining the origins of e-sport as both a marketized event and experiential commodity, we see this period as a transitory era bridging different phases in the areas of sports, marketing, and technology, resulting in the expansion of competitive cyberathleticism.},

The online sports betting industry has become a rapidly growing sector of the global economy, with online sports betting contributing 37% of the annual online gambling market in Europe. There has been an integration of social and technological processes that has enabled the cultural saliency of contemporary online betting. One of the more newly introduced forms of online sports betting is in-play sports betting behaviour (the betting on events within a sporting event such as football and cricket). In-play sports betting features (such as ‘cash out’) are increasing in popularity amongst online gambling operators. A scoping study was carried out examining the evolution of this new form of gambling practice which included both a systematic literature review and the examination of 338 online gambling websites that offered sports betting. The present study identified a comprehensive list of what in-play betting features are currently being offered on online gambling websites as well as other information concerning in-play sports betting. A total of 16 academic papers and two ‘grey literature’ reports and were identified in the systematic review. Out of 338 online gambling websites that were visited, 26% of these offered at least on in-play betting feature. Results from the systematic review suggest that in-play sports betting has the potential to be more harmful than other ways of gambling because of the inherent structural characteristics.}

The initial solution, implemented by four developers in a start-up, catered to users who connected to the system intermittently, for limited periods, via dial-up connections. Today’s system, engineered and maintained in 27 programming and markup languages by a team of 20 developers, is deployed in over 30 countries, integrated with over 50 third-party systems, and processes tens of millions daily transactions by over 680,000 players who are continuously using the system. This was accomplished via an an explicit focus on EmpireBet’s critical non-functional requirements; a modular, extensible architecture; a set of novel abstractions we introduced into the system; and several reusable libraries developed in the process.},

Taking sports into consideration, predicting outcomes, and extracting valuable information has become appealing not only to sports workers but also to the wider audience, particularly in the areas of team management and sports betting. The aim of this article is to review the existing machine learning (ML) algorithms in predicting sport outcomes. Over 100 papers were analyzed and only some of these papers were taken into consideration. Almost all of the analyzed papers use some sort of feature selection and feature extraction, most often prior to using the machine-learning algorithm. As an evaluation method of ML algorithms, researchers, in most cases, use data segmentation with data being chronologically distributed. In addition to data segmentation, researchers also use the k-cross-evaluation method. Sport predictions are usually treated as a classification problem with one class being predicted and rare cases being predicted as numerical values. Mostly used ML models are neural networks using data segmentation. This article is categorized under: Technologies > Machine Learning Technologies > Prediction},

A new development in the world of digital gaming, however, is the emergence of professional computer game play, complete with star players, team owners, tournaments, sponsorships, and spectators. In Raising the Stakes, T. L. Taylor explores the emerging scene of professional computer gaming and the accompanying efforts to make a sport out of this form of play.In the course of her explorations, Taylor travels to tournaments, including the World Cyber Games Grand Finals (which considers itself the computer gaming equivalent of the Olympics), and interviews participants from players to broadcasters. She examines pro-gaming, with its highly paid players, play-by-play broadcasts, and mass audience; discusses whether or not e-sports should even be considered sports; traces the player's path from amateur to professional (and how a hobby becomes work); and describes the importance of leagues, teams, owners, organizers, referees, sponsors, and fans in shaping the structure and culture of pro-gaming.Taylor connects professional computer gaming to broader issues: our notions of play, work, and sport; the nature of spectatorship; the influence of money on sports. And she examines the ongoing struggle over the gendered construction of play through the lens of male-dominated pro-gaming. Ultimately, the evolution of professional computer gaming illuminates the contemporary struggle to convert playful passions into serious play.}",

  abstract={Win probabilities have become a staple on scoreboards in physical sports such as baseball and basketball. Esports, or competitive video games with sponsored teams and major audiences, typically lack this detailed statistical analysis, beyond bare-bones metrics and commentator intuition. However, the advantage of esports in their tendency to have a central record of every game event makes them ripe for statistical analysis through machine learning. Previous research has covered popular video game genres such as MOBAs, and has found success in predicting game winners most of the time. Counterstrike: Global Offensive (CSGO) is an esport that is unique in its round and game-based nature, allowing researchers to examine how short and long-term decisions can interplay in competitive environments. We introduce a dataset of CSGO games To assess factors such as player purchasing decisions and individual scores, we introduce 3 round and game win probability models. Finally, we evaluate the performances of the models. We successfully predict winners in the majority of cases, better than the map average baseline win statistics.},

	abstract  = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},
